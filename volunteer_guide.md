## What is the DEF CON 29 RTV CTF?

The DEFCON Red Team Village CTF will be hosted by Threat Simulations! We have an another amazing, immersive scenario that stresses strong red team skills as players traverse through an enterprise network.

The target is interested in hiring a skilled red team for an upcoming engagement scheduled for 7 August 2021. The goal of this full scope engagement is to see if teams can access the 'crown jewels' and best of all, NO REPORT REQUIRED!
